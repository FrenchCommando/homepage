Retirement - Different in different countries - but similar idea:
when you're old you can't make money anymore, so you'll receive a pension.
It's hard to think about it because it makes you think about death;
so you can't plan for it.

Fundamentally unfair - why would I give money to old people.

From globalization -> I can optimize future income by applying in multiple countries
but again, you don't because you don't want to plan your death
the people who are good at it are the people who are planning other people's death
(this concept must have a name:
paying a premium because you let someone else think your death at your place
Adam Conover must have talked about it in a video)

By design, it's meant to maintain income inequality.
For poor people: "can't wait to reach retirement - I'm so exhausted from working hard all the time - Finally I can just collect!".
For rich people: "why would I retire, I'm just sitting there collecting cash - well, let's just do it".

Economics ? - Is is a liberal or conservative concept?
It sounds like some social gain but it is in fact having the opposite effect? - Like minimum wage?
Profiting people to know how to plan for it -> like some legal tax evasion.

Fiscal and Monetary -> you just stop thinking after hearing these words.
What's the purpose of money? What is really money? - There must be some real answers
Not talking about this here.
