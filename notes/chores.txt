Actually CHORES became another topic.

Spoiled kids that never took out the trash, emptied the dishwasher, or held a broom,
make perfectly good humans - there is no elevating nature of doing chores,
it's ok to have a maid - you're not going to hell for that.

Elevating nature is present in all cultures
Associated with humility

Whatever
