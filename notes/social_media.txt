A lot to think after watching "the Social Dilemma"

I do spend too much time on social networks.

(Like many?) I uninstalled Facebook and Instagram - Youtube only held for a day.
It's like dating apps when you get frustrated.

Also when you pay attention to it, there are ads everywhere.
You think: "this guy is making money on my back"
Same nature as mining Bitcoins in clients'CPU, but not as bad?
- Maybe it's even worse cause you are mining the client's brain ?

Hosting a website costs nothing.

Services that could be free should be free.

I don't like that my weather app tries to sell me stuff on Amazon.

I deactivated AdBlock on Youtube by mistake once
-> so many ads - not nice user experience
There is a hype around Youtubers being freelancers/influencers/independent
But they are only-glorified sales-people.
If you watch Youtube a lot like I do, it's important to step back and think about it.
Most people (hopefully) don't spend hours on Youtube everyday.
And they watch content that is completely different from what you're watching.
-> log off from you account, or go on incognito mode - you'll see kitties
