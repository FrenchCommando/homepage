use nginx and html
this page is using the css of the apache index
(apache works too, but I feel that there is more support for nginx now)

html should be fine - some js to get a little bit fancy
maybe some php - I'll stay away from python frameworks for simple websites

home server using raspberrypi and router - it is simple and makes you feel like a million bucks

domain ? - Google Domains, because they already have my credit card
good google interface but shows some available domains when they are not
-> you'll get too excited when you see that you can buy gmail.us
